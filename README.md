# Flight Data Analysis and Visualization

## Overview
This project provides tools for analyzing and visualizing flight data stored in a SQLite database. It includes functionalities to query and display flight details, and visualize the percentage of delayed flights per airline using various Python libraries.

## Features
- Query flight details by flight ID.
- List flights by a specific date.
- Display delayed flights by airline or origin airport.
- Visualize the percentage of delayed flights per airline.

## Setup
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/eneh4kene/Flights_data.git
    cd Flights_data
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
    ```sh
    python -m venv sky_sql
    source sky_sql/bin/activate  # On Windows: sky_sql\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Database
Ensure that the `flights.sqlite3` database file is placed in the `data` directory.

## Usage
1. Run the main program:
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```

2. Follow the menu prompts to query flight data or generate visualizations.

### Menu Options
1. Show flight by ID
2. Show flights by date
3. Delayed flights by airline
4. Delayed flights by origin airport
5. Visualize percentage of delayed flights per airline
6. Exit

### Visualizations
The visualization module provides a bar plot of the percentage of delayed flights per airline.

## Visualization Example
To visualize the percentage of delayed flights per airline, select option 5 from the menu. The program will generate a bar plot using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
